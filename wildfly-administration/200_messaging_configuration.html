## Messaging systems

* managing application messages
  * delivering them to recipients
* decouple senders and recipients
* Java EE
  * Java Messaging Service (JMS) - unified API

???
* Messaging systems decouple a message’s sender of messages from it consumer(s). In fact, the senders and consumers of messages are completely independent and know nothing of each other, which allows you to create flexible, loosely coupled systems. Large enterprises often use a messaging system to implement a message bus which loosely couples heterogeneous systems together. Message buses can form the core of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Using a message bus to decouple disparate systems allows the system to grow and adapt more easily. It also allows more flexibility to add new systems or retire old ones since they don’t have brittle dependencies on each other.
* EE 7 - JMS 2.0, JSR 343 - https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=343

--

### Messaging styles & Destinations

* Point-to-Point
  * Queue
* Publish-Subscribe
  * Topic

???
* P2P - each message received by only one consumer
* P-S - message received by all subscribers
  * Another interesting distinction is that **subscribers can be durable**. Durable subscriptions pass the server a unique identifier when connecting, which allows the server to identify and send any messages published to the topic since the last time the subscriber made a connection. Such messages are typically retained by the server even after a restart.
  
## Destinations
JMS destinations, along with JMS connection factories, are JMS administrative objects. Destinations are used by JMS clients for both producing and consuming messages.

## Connectors and Acceptors

* Connectors
  * used by clients to connect to WildFly JMS server
  * define the transport and connection parameters
* Acceptors
  * connector's counterpart on server
  * defines connection types accepted by server

--

### Types: `*-connector` / `*-acceptor`

* `in-vm` - communication with local clients in the same JVM
* `remote` - for remote clients - uses Netty
* `http` - for remote clients - uses Undertow

???
There are three kind of connectors that can be used to connect to WildFly JMS Server

* in-vm-connector can be used by a local client (i.e. one running in the same JVM as the server)
* remote-connector can be used by a remote client (and uses Netty over TCP for the communication)
* http-connector can be used by a remote client (and uses Undertow Web Server to upgrade from a HTTP connection)

---

## Connection factories
* used by clients to make connections to the server
* reference connectors
* types
  * `connection-factory`
  * `pooled-connection-factory`
  * *`legacy-connection-factory` - HornetQ factory*
* remote usage (`connection-factory`)
  * JNDI name prefix *"java:jboss/exported"*

???
* https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/Messaging+configuration#Messagingconfiguration-JMSConnectionFactories
* Only JNDI names bound in the "java:jboss/exported" namespace are available to remote clients.  If a connection-factory has an entry bound in the "java:jboss/exported" namespace a remote client would look-up the connection-factory using the text after "java:jboss/exported".  For example, the "RemoteConnectionFactory" is bound by default to "java:jboss/exported/jms/RemoteConnectionFactory" which means a remote client would look-up this connection-factory using "jms/RemoteConnectionFactory".  A pooled-connection-factory should not have any entry bound in the "java:jboss/exported" namespace because a pooled-connection-factory is not suitable for remote clients.

--

### The pooled-connection factory
* only available to local clients, but may reference a remote server
* configurable pool - better performance
* usage:
  * in MDB (inbound)
  * JNDI lookup (outbound - only for sending messages)

---
## JMS Queues and Topics

### JBoss CLI
```bash
jms-topic add --topic-address=myTopic \
  --entries=[jms/topic/myTopic java:jboss/exported/jms/topic/myTopic]

jms-queue add --queue-address=myQueue \
  --entries=[jms/queue/myQueue java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/myQueue]
```

--

### Result
```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:messaging-activemq:2.0">
  <server name="default">
...
    <jms-queue name="myQueue"
               entries="jms/queue/myQueue java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/myQueue" />
    <jms-topic name="myTopic"
               entries="jms/topic/myTopic java:jboss/exported/jms/topic/myTopict" />
...
</subsystem>
```
---
## Special queues

--

### Dead Letter Queue

* destination for messages with delivery problems
  * e.g. message reach max delivery attempts

???
* JBoss AS 5.1 sample http://middlewaremagic.com/jboss/?p=1227

--

### Expiry Queue

* destination for expired messages
  * expiry reaper thread examines periodically the messages

???
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.0/html-single/configuring_messaging/#set_message_expiry
You can specify where to send expired messages by setting an expiry address. If a message expires and no expiry address is specified, the message is removed from the queue and dropped.
--

### Last-value Queues
* able to discard message when a new come
  * when they have the same value of message property `_AMQ_LVQ_NAME`
* configured in Address settings

```xml
<address-setting name="jms.queue.lastValue" last-value-queue="true" />
```

---
## Address settings

* how and when are messages delivered
* redelivery and expiration options

--

### Default config
```xml
<address-setting name="#"
  dead-letter-address="jms.queue.DLQ" expiry-address="jms.queue.ExpiryQueue"
  max-size-bytes="10485760" page-size-bytes="2097152"
  message-counter-history-day-limit="10"
  redistribution-delay="1000"/>
```
???
* default address setting

---
## Address name - Wildcard syntax

* `"#"` any sequence of zero or more words
* `"*"` a single word
* `"."` word separator

--

### Examples

* `wildfly.training.#` - Matches `wildfly.training`, `wildfly.training.brno`, `wildfly.training.lesson.messaging`
* `brno.*` - Matches `brno.training`, `brno.cz`, but not `brno.training.wildfly`
* `jms.*.myDest` - Matches `jms.queue.myDest`, `jms.topic.myDest`

---
## Messaging security

### Destinations and Role Based Access Control

* by default the `messaging-activemq` subsystem uses the `"other"` security domain in `security` subsystem
  * references application security realm: `ApplicationRealm`
  * use `./add-user.sh` script to create users with required roles

--

```adoc
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/security-setting=#:read-resource(recursive=true)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {"role" => {"guest" => {
        "consume" => true,
        "create-durable-queue" => false,
        "create-non-durable-queue" => true,
        "delete-durable-queue" => false,
        "delete-non-durable-queue" => true,
        "manage" => false,
        "send" => true
    }}}
}
```
---
## Security - Permissions
* `create-durable-queue`
* `delete-durable-queue`
* `create-non-durable-queue`
* `delete-non-durable-queue`
* `send`
* `consume`
* `manage`
  - invoke management operations

*Permission grants are based on matching address and role name.*

???
- invoke management operations by sending management messages to the management address
---

## Transport security - SSL/TLS

* `http-connector` / `http-acceptor`
  * `https` connector in Undertow subsystem (OOTB)
  * `ssl` identity in `ApplicationRealm` security realm configuration (OOTB)
  * use `https` listener in `http-listener` attribute of `http-acceptor`
  * add acceptor parameter `ssl-enabled=true`
* `remote-connector`
  * configuration as acceptor parameters
      * keystore, truststore, protocol, ...
      * acceptor parameter `ssl-enabled=true`

???

## Persistence

* Artemis handles persistence itself
  * high performance journal
  * optimized for messaging
* journals - pluggable API, shipped with 2 implementations
  * Java NIO
  * Linux Asynchronous IO (`libaio`)
      * Kernel 2.6+
      * FS: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs

???
* https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/AIO+-+NIO+for+messaging+journal

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a high performance journal. Since Apache ActiveMQ Artemis handles its own persistence, rather than relying on a database or other 3rd party persistence engine it is very highly optimised for the specific messaging use cases. The majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out the interaction with the actual file system to allow different pluggable implementations.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two implementations:

Java NIO.
The first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with the file system. This provides extremely good performance and runs on any platform where there's a Java 6+ runtime.

Linux Asynchronous IO
The second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to the Linux asynchronous IO library (AIO). With AIO, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will be called back when the data has made it to disk, allowing us to avoid explicit syncs altogether and simply send back confirmation of completion when AIO informs us that the data has been persisted.

Using AIO will typically provide even better performance than using Java NIO.

The AIO journal is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and after having installed libaio (if it's not already installed).

Also, please note that AIO will only work with the following file systems: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs. With other file systems, e.g. NFS it may appear to work, but it will fall back to a slower synchronous behaviour. Don't put the journal on a NFS share!

One point that should be added is that AIO doesn't work well with encrypted partitions, thus you have to move to NIO on those.
