### Prepare
* browser:
  * this presentation
  * https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v5.3.5/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-security-hardened.xml
  * https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/v5.3.5/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-full-example.xml
  * https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/docs/design/security/README.adoc

### Abstract

If you are new in the great kingdom of Hazelcast security, or if you just need to refresh what we are selling to our Enterprise Platform customers, please join us for a high-level overview of our security features.

This should be a kick-off for monthly (or occasional) presentations focused on security features.

---

## Agenda

* Communication Security
* Authentication
* Authorization / Client Permissions
* Persistence Encryption
* Auditlog
* Secrets Strength Validation
* Pluggable Security

???
## Focus areas

3 main areas
* Protecting communication on supported protocols
* Limit who can join the cluster and work with data

and then we will also cover other topics
* data-at-rest encryption - which is available for our Persistence feature
* Auditlog
* Checking if secrets used in configuration match the policy 

and we will finish by listing our extension points, where users can plugin their security module implementations

---
## Communication Security - Background

Hazelcast is a network-based system.

For attackers, it's easy to capture unprotected network communication.

* Hazelcast members support different application layer protocols - all TCP-based
 * Hazelcast Member Protocol (`HZC`)
 * Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol (`CP2`)
 * HTTP REST
 * memcached protocol (disabled by default)
???

memcached is a distributed key/value cache

--

* Members support two networking modes
    * **`default`** - member networking accepts all protocols on a single port (default: `5701`)
    * **`advanced`** - each protocol binds to its socket address - the ports are different
--
* Members support multiple discovery strategies to find each other
  * Multicast discovery is the default in some Hazelcast packages

--
* Members do calls to external systems

---
## Communication Security - Basics - OS/Community

* Advanced networking
  * specify which protocols will be accessible from outside
  * allows employing firewalls

--
* Management operation protection on Client protocol
  * specify from which IP addresses cluster management operations can be executed

--
* Untrusted deserialization protection
  * allows configuring allow-lists/deny-lists for deserializing Java classes

---

## Communication Security - Basics - TLS
 
* TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security) -  based on public-key cryptography; asymmetric encryption used for key exchange; symmetric encryption used for data transmission 
  * by default, server doesn't check client's identity; mutual authentication has to be enabled to do so;
  * Hazelcast supports native Java TLS implementation (JSSE) and netty bindings to other engines (OpenSSL &amp; BoringSSL)

.grey[
* Hazelcast Symmetric Encryption (deprecated feature)
  * only available for Hazelcast Member protocol
  * compared to TLS, it encrypts also the datagrams in Multicast discovery strategy
]

---
## Communication Security - Rule of thumb

&nbsp;

.center[*If a Hazelcast feature communicates **over network**, it **allows configuring encryption** (usually TLS).*]

&nbsp;

### Sample areas where the rule is applied

* supported application protocols
* Hazelcast discovery strategies
* Jet connectors to external sources and sinks
* API calls to Kubernetes and other HTTP client calls

---

## Authentication

* **Mutual TLS** Authentication
  * TLS has to be enabled
  * available for all protocols
  * configured in the networking configuration sections
* **Hazelcast Authentication** - part of Hazelcast Security suite
  * security has to be enabled
  * supported on protocols: Member, Client, REST (partly)
  * entry-point for Hazelcast Authorization (Client Permissions)

???

Basically, we can find two authentication types in Hazelcast.
---

## Authentication - Hazelcast Authentication

*Hazelcast Authentication is responsible for **verifying identity of the connecting party** (client-side on the given application protocol). It also **assigns roles** to the party. Roles can be later used during the authorization.*

Out-of-the-box provided mechanisms:
* **`simple`** - users and their roles directly configured in the Hazelcast member configuration file
* **`ldap`** - users and roles configured in an LDAP server
* **`kerberos`** (+`ldap`) - authentication based on kerberos ticket verification, roles can be loaded from underlying LDAP server (if there is any)
* **`tls`** - can be used when the mutual TLS authentication is configured to load roles from the client's X.509 certificate

*There is also a simple **default**/fallback mechanism. It's used when no explicit authentication is configured and security is enabled.*

???

**Hazelcast Identity Configuration** is part of the authentication, but we'll cover it when we'll talk in more detail about the Authentication in one of the next rounds.

---

## Authorization / Client permissions

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is available in Hazelcast. It can be configured for the Client Protocol.

* Permissions are mapped (granted) to roles in the Member configuration.
* Clients get the roles assigned during authentication.
* Before a task requested by a client is executed, the permission required for the given task is checked.

--
### Simplicity vs flexibility

When users first meet the Client permissions, they can struggle with the configuration complexity. It's a price for greater flexibility of the permission-based solution. It allows

* using custom role names (e.g. from LDAP object "uid=jduke,ou=Accounting,o=Hazelcast" use "Accounting" as the role name)
* assigning permission for certain data structure types and object names (e.g. the `"Accounting"` role has `read &amp; write` access to an `IMap` structure named "Invoices")
* executing some operation from certain remote addresses only; 

---

## Persistence Encryption

> *Persistence allows members to recover data by persisting map entries, JCache data, and streaming job snapshots on disk. Members can use persisted data to recover from a planned shutdown, a sudden cluster-wide crash, or a single member failure.*

Hazelcast supports encryption of the data stored in a filesystem by the Persistence feature.

---

## Auditlog

* allows observing some important events, E.g.
  * network connections lifecycle
  * authentications
  * cluster lifecycle
* default implementation uses Hazelcast logging

???
logging category `hazelcast.auditlog`
---

## Secrets Strength Validation

* validate passwords in a member configuration
  * minimal secret length
  * large keyspace
  * no dictionary words
* prints warning banner during member startup
* may be enforced (i.e. prevents the member from starting)

*The feature is **only** configured via **System Properties**.*

```
-Dhazelcast.security.secret.strength.policy.enforced=true \
-Dhazelcast.security.dictionary.policy.wordlist.path=/opt/wordlist.txt \
-Dhazelcast.security.secret.policy.min.length=10
```

---

## Pluggable Security

Several Hazelcast features contain an SPI that allows users to plug in their implementations.

Security-related integration points/interfaces:


* `LoginModule` (Java interface) - for custom credentials verification and role assignment
* `ICredentialFactory` - enables programmatically generating credentials (username/password combinations or tokens);
* `SocketIntercetptor` - allows custom negotiations when a new connection to a member is established;
* `SecurityInterceptor` - enables implementation of finer-grained authorization (ABAC - Attribute-based access control);
* `Auditlog` - allows different message formatting and logging to various external log systems;
* `SecretStrengthPolicy` - for custom secrets validator;
* `SSLContextFactory` and `SSLEngineFactory` - for custom TLS implementations;
* `IPermissionPolicy` - for custom permission mapping implementation.

## `-Dhazelcast.security.recommendations`

???

Set the hazelcast.security.recommendations system property when starting a member to review a list of recommendations

---

## Roadmap

* **New REST** with better security implementation
* **Deny permissions**
* support **external secret stores**
